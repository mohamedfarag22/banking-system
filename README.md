# Customer Banking System

A simple command-line banking system built in Python that allows users to create accounts, log in, manage their balance by depositing or withdrawing funds, and check their account balance. This system simulates basic banking operations using a class-based approach.

## Features
- **Account Creation**: Users can create an account by providing their name, phone number, ID card, password, and initial deposit.
- **Login System**: Secure login with phone number and password.
- **Deposit & Withdraw**: Users can deposit and withdraw money from their accounts.
- **Check Balance**: Users can view their current account balance.
- **Data Storage**: All customer information is stored in a dictionary, where the phone number serves as the unique identifier.

## How It Works
1. **Create Account**: Users provide their details (name, phone number, ID card, password, and initial deposit) to create an account.
2. **Login**: Users log in using their phone number and password.
3. **Banking Operations**: After logging in, users can:
   - Deposit money into their account.
   - Withdraw funds (with insufficient funds check).
   - Check their balance.
4. **Exit**: Users can exit the program at any time.
